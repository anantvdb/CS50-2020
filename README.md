# CS50x 2020
This is my personal repository for Harvard University's **CS50 Introduction to Computer Science** course.

Here you can find the project submissions, as well as the notes I take during the lectures.

The course itself is available through [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
